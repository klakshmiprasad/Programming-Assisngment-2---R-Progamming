#Matrix inversion 

# makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
# inverse from the cache.

# Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, 
# then solve(X) returns its inverse.
